# Team performance & progress monitoring
It is the SCRUM master’s task to evaluate the performance of individual team members, as well as the team’s combined efforts. These should be done weekly.
Every team member has an obligation to observe and review progress and make suggestions about changes to the project. Every 7th day we review the week and iterations, and see the progress. Afterwards we shift our focus accordingly.
